# *Welcome to Group-37 GitLab Repository*

## 1. Repository Rules
* When the repository has been cloned do create your own branches to avoid **MERGE CONFLICT**
* Always Check for any recent changes by using
```bash
git status
```
if any changes are detected use
```bash
git pull origin main
```

* After working on your local branch push it to the main branch
```bash
git add .
git commit -a -m "Commit Message"
git push --set-upstream origin your-branch-name
```

* After Setting **upstream** to the origin branch You can use this as normal 
```bash
git push
```

* Now Youll need to Merge the Commit from your local branch to the main branch

* If you go to **Merge Request** you can use it to merge the commit
